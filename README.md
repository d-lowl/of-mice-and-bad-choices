Itch.io (Web, Win, Linux): [Of Mice and Bad Choices](https://dlowl.itch.io/of-mice-and-bad-choices)

The game was made for the [Siberian Game Jam November 2023](https://itch.io/jam/sibgamejam-nov-2023)

"I'm Reggie, the Elder Mouse trying to stop our reckless young'uns from nibbling those nasty cacti. They won't listen to reason, so I've got a cunning cheese plan to lure them out of danger with aromatic fromage. Help me strategically place smelly cheeses around our maze, using their powerful scents to redirect these unruly mice away from the prickly plants. My nose can barely take the stench, but with your puzzle solving skills we can steer them straight out of the warren. I may be old, but I ain't letting these young mice make mousetakes on my watch!"

Aim: lead young mice to the elder mouse

Controls:

* TAB or Show Hints button -- will show "cheese smell"
* SPACE or Play button -- play the level; mice will walk according to the rules below
* 1-5 or Inventory buttons at the top -- choose cheese colour
* LMB -- put cheese down (you can put cheese at an empty cell, or at a cell that has cheese of the same colour)

Mechanics:

* Mice have a cheese colour preference (shown at the top of their heads)

* Mice move towards the elder mouse if they can be seen directly, when they can
* Mice move towards their prefferred cheese of the greatest amount, when the can
